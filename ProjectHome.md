wpfinger is a tool that can analyze the Wordpress plugin repository and generate signatures based on diffs between each version of the plugin. It can then use these signatures to scan a website running Wordpress, and detect the presence of any plugin in the repository as well as infer the installed version.

wpfinger is written in Python, and expects Python 2.5 or above. To use the repository checkout feature, you must also have subversion installed.
